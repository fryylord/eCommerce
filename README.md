## Installation

In the command line in the root directory, type npm install allowing for the required libraries to be installed.
A program used for interacting with a database (such as insomnia) is also recommended.  

## Usage

The application can be initialized by typing node server.js within the directory in which it resides.  

This will activate the server on port 3001.  Within Insomnia, you are able to initiate get, put, post, and delete functions.
